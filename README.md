###*The Minimalist Portfolio*

#####1st Commit

The first commit to this repository contains the file structure to set up of a minimalist themed portfolio website. 

The website has a very simple and clean design and will rely on AJAX calls to the server for fresh content.

#####2nd Commit

In the 2nd commit I've added the navigation and body text. Navigation is concealed at 41.25ems and below to be revealed by pressing the "hamburger" icon.

Body content scales up from a stacked view to a three column layout for screen widths above 41.25ems.

#####3rd Commit

Home page has been fleshed out and footer added. All widths are in ems and percentages for a completely fluid experience.
