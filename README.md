### The Minimalist Portfolio
------
##### 1st Commit

The first commit to this repository contains the file structure to set up of a minimalist themed portfolio website. 

The website has a very simple and clean design and will rely on AJAX calls to the server for fresh content.

------
##### 2nd Commit

In the 2nd commit I've added the navigation and body text. Navigation is concealed at 41.25ems and below to be revealed by pressing the "hamburger" icon.

Body content scales up from a stacked view to a three column layout for screen widths above 41.25ems.

##### 3rd Commit

Home page has been fleshed out and footer added. All widths are in ems and percentages for a completely fluid experience. 

------
##### 4th Commit

Fixed HTML and CSS output so that it fully validates based on W3C standards. Fixed a bug in navigation to select the "hamburger" icon only and not the whole navigation element. All classes are named with BEM conventions. SASS can be refactored to remove bloat at a later date.

##### 5th Commit

Stuck footer at the bottom of the page so it would not creep up into the middle of the page if there was little content on the page. Fixed a layout bug in footer so icons will not collapse on mobile devices. I Started the code for the projects page but will need to complete layout as well as enter content into the home and about pages.

##### 6th Commit

Added copy to home page and about page. Changed headshot image width proportions on mobile and desktop views on about page. Edited line height and font size of about copy.

------
##### 7th Commit

Deleted projects.html and added a folder for projects with an index.html file that is the same as projects.html. The projects folder will house all the information for the sites and apps that will go in the portfolio gallery.

##### 8th Commit
